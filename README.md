About Myself
============

Hi there, I'm Subham Kumar M! ðŸ‘‹

  

Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I'm currently a Computer Science and Engineering student at Gayatri Vidya Parishad College for PG and Degree, nestled in the beautiful city of Vizag.

A Bit About Me:

I'm on a quest to decode the world of technology, one line of code at a time. My toolkit includes **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, with a sprinkle of Java for flavor**. I enjoy diving into projects that challenge my skills and push me to learn more every day.

*   **HTML/CSS:** I can make your website look like a million bucks (or at least a really nice cup of coffee).
    
*   **JavaScript:** If your website needs some pizzazz, I've got the scripts to make it dance.
    
*   **Python:** Whether it's web development, data science, or just automating my coffee orders, Python is my go-to.
    
*   **Java:** I'm not a Java ninja yet, but I can definitely brew up something useful.
    
*   **Power BI:** Turning data into visually compelling stories is my kind of fun.
    
*   **Excel:** I can tame the wildest spreadsheets, from pivot tables to complex formulas.
    
*   **MySQL:** The whole suite is my playgroundâ€”I can make databases, presentations, and ER models look and work better than ever.
    
*   **Word:** Words are my second language, and Word is my favorite tool for speaking it.
